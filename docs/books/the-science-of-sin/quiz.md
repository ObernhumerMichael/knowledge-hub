   - it ramps up sensitivity of the reward pathway to the delicious-looking and appetizing aroma of high-calorie foods.
   - it weakens lines of communication between the reward pathway and brain areas responsible for reining in the urge to consume those scrumptious temptations.

## Lust

1. What is white brain matter?
   - white brain matter = information superhighways (150 m/s instead of normal 10 m/s)
1. How does the brain of a pedophile differ from a normal one?
   - There are significant differences in the white matter tracts of pedophile brains compared to non-pedophile ones.
   - The 'sexual response network' brain areas that govern healthy sexual responses in the rest of us seem to be hyperactive in the pedophile, even at rest.
1. How does the attractiveness ratings of men change in the different menstrual cycles?

## Envy

1. Why is envy considered unpleasant compared to other vices?
   - Unlike lust, greed, or pride, which bring pleasure or satisfaction, envy offers no gratification. It only makes people feel worse by comparing themselves unfavorably to others.

   - Envy can escalate into malicious acts. The acid attack by Mary Konye on Naomi Oni is a key example where long-term envy turned into violent crime.
1. What brain areas are involved in envy?
   - Envy activates the **dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC)** (linked to social pain and comparison).
   - It decreases activity in the **ventral striatum** (reward center).
   - Chronic envy correlates with a smaller **dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC)**, which helps with self-control.
1. How does social media amplify envy?
   - Social media presents exaggerated success stories and filtered realities.
   - Passive users feel more envy and can develop depression.
   - Platforms like Facebook trigger envy more effectively because they involve close social circles.

   - However, if unchecked, it can turn into **malicious envy** leading to harmful behaviors.

## Wrath

1. What brain region is most associated with the urge for revenge?
   - The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) – stronger ACC activation correlates with a greater desire for retaliation.
1. How does evolutionary theory explain the retention of wrath in humans?
   - Wrath conferred survival advantages by enabling resource acquisition and reproductive opportunities despite high risks.
1. What distinguishes instrumental aggression from reactive aggression?
