## In the Beginning

### Notes

- 7 deadly sins: pride, gluttony, lust, sloth, greed, envy, wrath
- The sins are not entirely evil, e.g. lust is necessary for the survival of a species.
- Neuroplasticity describes the process by which more or less anything we do regularly and intensively, and sustain over long periods of time, induces physical changes in the very fabric of our brain.
- InGroup: The group of people you identify with and show loyalty, empathy, and trust toward. (max 150 people)
- OutGroup: The group of people perceived as different or outside your social circle, often treated with less empathy or fairness.
- 7 deadly sins = categories of human behavior that leads to dispute and social isolation
- Gods help to enforce codes of conduct (e.g. punish vices)
- The concept of religious coping suggests that blaming god for disasters helps people deal with stress and traumatic events.
- Gods help to organize very large groups of interacting humans under a shared belief system.
- Belief helps us to cooperate with the OutGroup.
- When a belief system places constraint on what other people should and shouldn’t think, it goes too far, particularly when used to sanction violence.

### Questions

- What is Neuroplasticity?
- What is InGroup and OutGroup?
- What is the role of god/religion in society?
- In an increasingly post-religious world, where is the incentive to stay on the right side of the seven deadly sins?
- Is science sufficient to inspire us to do the things that keep us happy and healthy?

### Summary

The seven deadly sins (albeit necessary sometimes) are behaviors that lead to conflicts and social isolation.
God/religion are concepts that help to maintain order and cooperation between a large group of humans.
Religion fostered group membership, but what will fill the gap with the increasing disbelief remains to see.

## Pride

### Notes

- Pride can be a positive as it helps use conquering our fears and stay motivated in the face of adversaries.
- The problem are the extremes.
- There is a big difference between feeling proud and letting it show to the outside world.
- The self-obsession of pride prevents meaningful relationships with others.
- The sin of pride is formed when a person beliefs they are superior to all others.
  - =narcissism
- vanity is one of 7 contributing factors
  - it has risen dramatically in recent years (e.g. plastic surgery, social media)
- Narcissists are self-absorbed, belligerently indifferent to other people’s opinions or best interests, and fully prepared to manipulate others to get what they want.
- The same brain areas that light up when we feel physical pain also become activated when we feel social pain.
  - Narcissists seem to feel the social pain of rejection more powerfully than other people.
- Neglectful- & Helicopter parents prevent the child from forming a healthy independent sense of self.
  - There is also trouble when feedback is framed in absolute terms that sound much more permanent: "You are such a naughty child"

### Questions

- Why do we need pride?
- What are the consequences of the sin of pride?
- When is pride a sin?
- How to foster narcissism through parenting?
- How does the internet nurture narcissism?

### Summary

Pride in moderate amounts is a virtue otherwise it is a vice.
Narcissism prevents meaningful relationships with others through a superiority belief.
Parenting has a big impact on the development of narcissism.

## Gluttony

### Notes

- It’s not easy to find concrete boundaries that define where moderation ends and gluttony begins.
- Common psychological motivations for overeating are varied but usually reflect a set-piece response to negative emotions, often generated by body image problems in the first place.
- While greed is probably best thought of as the desire to take more than your fair share of any given commodity, gluttony refers specifically to gulping down food and/or drink in extremely large quantities.
- Gluttony is different from the other deadly sins in that the toll it takes on the body, when practiced daily, is usually impossible to conceal from the outside world
- The feeling of satiety arrives only after about 20 - 30min.
- We feel lethargic after a large meal partly because our stomachs are hogging all the blood and partly because hormones are released into the bloodstream.
- The stress hormone cortisol does two things to our brain to facilitate the total demolition of self-control.
  1. it ramps up sensitivity of the reward pathway to the delicious-looking and appetizing aroma of high-calorie foods.
  2. it weakens lines of communication between the reward pathway and brain areas responsible for reining in the urge to consume those scrumptious temptations.
- The quality of the previous night’s sleep has a powerful impact on appetite regulation.
- Avoid eating something a few hours before going to bed to improve sleep quality.
- obesity accelerates the rate at which the brain ages
- Obesity gradually alters the hypothalamus, which regulates appetite, increasing the drive to seek out food.
  This change is irreversible, regardless of exercise or diet.
- The environment plays a significant role for obese families.

### Questions / Keywords

- psychological motivations
- What is gluttony?
- Why should one eat food slowly?
- What 2 things does the stress hormone cortisol do to facilitate a loss of self-control?
- What has sleep to do with gluttony?
- What does obesity change in the brain?

### Summary

Gluttony brings destruction onto one's body and causes life threatening health conditions.
Key players are stress (cortisol) and sleep (quality).
Obesity makes irreversible changes to the brain.

## Lust

### Notes

- We know statistically that a proportion of people in any given community will, find themselves more sexually attracted to children than adults.
- There are significant differences in the white matter tracts of pedophile brains compared to non-pedophile ones.
- white brain matter = information superhighways (150 m/s instead of normal 10 m/s)
- The 'sexual response network' brain areas that govern healthy sexual responses in the rest of us seem to be hyperactive in the pedophile, even at rest.
- The physiological component of female sexual arousal may be a reflex designed to protect the vaginal canal from damage.
- During the fertile phase of the cycle, the attractiveness ratings the women gave for more masculine-looking faces, bodies and deeper-sounding voices increased slightly.
- On the other hand, during the non-fertile weeks of the menstrual cycle, the attractiveness ratings for the more feminine male faces, bodies and voices increased slightly.
- Despite being tightly interwoven, the three systems of lust, romantic love and long-term commitment can nonetheless operate relatively independently.
  - durations: lust:minutes, romantic love: 8-18 months, long-term commitment: years
- The sexual arousal one feels may be involuntary and beyond ones control.
  Choosing to act on that sexual arousal is another matter entirely.
- it is suspected that a higher level of dopamine increases the sex drive
- Excessive use of pornography is impacting on healthy sexual behaviors.
- Once loyalty is betrayed and trust is broken, it can never really, truly, be fully recovered.

### Questions / Keywords

- What is white brain matter?
- How does the brain of a pedophile differ from a normal one?
- How does the attractiveness ratings of men change in the different menstrual cycles?
- lust, romantic love and long-term commitment

### Summary

Lust can be influenced to a large degree by the body but choosing to act on these impulses is another matter entirely.
Lust is temporary and one should strive for long term relationships.
Pornography can destroy relationships and encourage bad sexual behavior.

## Sloth

### Notes

- The seemingly pragmatic approach of conserving energy wherever possible is not only less satisfying but, can even be dire news for our health
- If we don’t take regular exercise, our health rapidly declines.
- People who don’t rest are prone to run themselves ragged, leaving their bodies no alternative than to force a complete shutdown to make the necessary repairs.
- Sloth can even be virtuous when the promise of future sloth incentives us to work harder right now
- long-term unemployment can actually have a negative impact on a personality trait (conscientiousness)
- Brain circuitry that is used infrequently, or not particularly intensively, falls into relative disrepair.
- Sloth: the opportunity to do something productive must have been shirked willingly, under circumstances where not bothering was a choice freely made.
- It may not be the most destructive form of antisocial behavior, but sloth is a sure-fire way to fall out of favour with the InGroup and find yourself left out in the cold.
- While there’s nothing wrong with using the digital tools of entertainment in moderation, there are serious potential negative impacts of having so much spare time used up in these sedentary pursuits.

### Questions

- When can sloth be virtuous?
- How does long-term unemployment impact our personality?
- What is sloth?

### Summary

Sloth, while sometimes disguised as conserving energy, often leads to declining health, weakened brain function, and social isolation when chosen freely over productive action.
Chronic idleness, like long-term unemployment or excessive digital entertainment, erodes conscientiousness and vitality.
True sloth isn’t about necessary rest but about shirking meaningful activity, ultimately damaging both personal well-being and community ties.

## Greed

### Notes

- Greed’s status as a capital vice is all about banishing **excessive** desire for wealth from society.
- Someone that has great wealth, often uses the power that comes with it to subordinate others.
- greed is the ultimate cause of all fraud, corruption and theft
- Humans would rather turn down free money than let another person get away with acting unfairly.
- Having a vast fortune may foster a sense of being insulated from the usual social or legal consequences of getting caught out.
- The tendency to cheat others out of their fair share appears to depend on the perception of how serious the consequences of getting caught are likely to be.
- Focusing on short-term profits in a system that will inevitably go horribly wrong in the long run is possibly one of the most worrying aspects of the sin of greed operating on a global scale.
- Globalization interferes with the local mechanisms that operate to control individual greed on a smaller scale, rendering them ineffective.

### Questions / Keywords

- How does wealth influence greed?
- origin of fraud, corruption and theft
- By what is the tendency to cheat others out of their fair share impacted by.
- How can greed operate on a global scale.
- In the Ultimatum Game, what surprising behavior did people show when faced with an unfair split?
- Is greed instinctive or does it require deliberate thought?
- What effect does wealth and formal education in economics have on people's tendency toward greed?
- What is necessary to prevent greed from causing large-scale harm?

### Summary

Greed has been condemned by religions and philosophers but also praised in modern economics as a driver of ambition.
It manifests in both cultural symbols and real-world frauds.
Neuroscience shows humans prefer fairness instinctively, but greed arises through deliberate thought.
Wealth and certain educations can amplify greed by dulling social consequences.
Globally, unchecked greed damages societies and ecosystems.
Solutions lie in stricter regulations and restoring consequences for unethical actions.

## Envy

### Notes

#### The Nature of Envy

- Unlike other vices (lust, greed, pride), envy brings no pleasure.
- Envy is triggered when someone similar to us has an advantage.
- We envy peers (friends, family, colleagues), not distant figures like royalty.
- Envy is unpleasant but varies in intensity — from a prickle to a stab.

#### Triggers of Envy

- Four prerequisites:
  - Comparable social status.
  - Relevance to our life.
  - Difficulty in obtaining the envied thing.
  - Perception that the advantage is undeserved.

#### Competence & Warmth

- People judged on competence and warmth:
  - High competence + low warmth → envy.
  - High in both → respect.
  - Low in both → scorn.
  - High warmth + low competence → pity.

#### Case Study: Mary Konye & Naomi Oni

- Mary’s envy of Naomi’s beauty escalated to violence.
- Led to a sulfuric acid attack causing permanent damage.
- Example of envy driving extreme, destructive acts.

#### Brain Science

- Envy activates:
  - **dACC** (anterior cingulate cortex) — social pain, comparison discomfort.
  - Decreases activity in **ventral striatum** — reducing reward feelings.
- Dispositional envy correlates with smaller **dlPFC** (self-control area).
- High emotional intelligence (EQ) helps dampen envy.

#### Origins & Evolution

- Envy arises from social emotions, appearing after self-awareness (18 months).
- Requires:
  - Self-awareness.
  - Theory of mind (others have feelings).
  - Understanding of social norms.
- Envy motivates action to correct perceived unfairness (either constructive or destructive).

#### Modern Society & Social Media

- Advertisers exploit envy using celebrities/influencers.
- Social media ("bragbook") exaggerates peers' success, triggering envy.
- Passive users (lurkers) are more prone to envy and depression.
- Case studies show deleting social media can reduce these feelings.

#### Schadenfreude (Pleasure at Others’ Misfortune)

- Opposite of envy: joy at rivals’ failures.
- Common in sports rivalries, media stories about fallen celebrities.
- Neuroscience links schadenfreude to ventral striatum activation and reduced empathy (AI suppression).
- Strong envy → stronger schadenfreude when rivals fail.

#### Benign vs. Malicious Envy

- **Benign envy**:
  - Inspires self-improvement.
  - Motivates harder work.
  - Can turn lazy people productive.
- **Malicious envy**:
  - Leads to sabotage, violence, or irrational behaviors (e.g., inheritance feuds, crimes).

### Questions

- Why is envy considered unpleasant compared to other vices?
- What conditions trigger envy?
- How does envy relate to competence and warmth?
- What role does envy play in violent crimes?
- What brain areas are involved in envy?
- How does social media amplify envy?
- What is the difference between envy and schadenfreude?
- Can envy be beneficial?

### Summary

Envy is a uniquely painful emotion triggered by upward comparison with similar peers.
Unlike other vices, it offers no pleasure and often leads to irrational or destructive behaviors.
Religions and philosophers have long warned against it.
Neuroscience shows envy activates areas linked to social pain and reduced rewards.
Modern advertising and social media amplify envy by showcasing curated successes, leading some to depression and social withdrawal.
However, envy can also have a positive side - benign envy - which motivates self-improvement and hard work.
Balancing this emotion is key to preventing its dark consequences while harnessing its motivational power.

## Wrath

### Notes

#### Wrath as a deadly sin

- Realm of excessive anger, aggression, violence.
- Leads to swift harm and death, separating people from loved ones.
- Can be hot-headed (impulsive) or cold-calculated (premeditated).

#### Evolutionary "advantage" of anger

- Confrontational aggression could yield resources, mating opportunities, power.
- Natural selection retained wrath because, despite risks, benefits often outweighed costs in pre‑civilized contexts.

#### Biological bases of anger

- **Amygdala & ACC**: Amygdala generates fear; ACC (anterior cingulate cortex) linked to vengeance.
- **Testosterone**: Critical in utero and adolescence; adult reductions have limited effect.
- **Prefrontal cortex** (dlPFC, dmPFC, OFC): Key for impulse control and decision-making; underdevelopment or damage can lead to poor anger regulation.

#### Types of aggression

- **Instrumental/proactive**: Cold, planned violence (e.g., academic shootings).
- **Reactive**: Hot-headed, impulsive aggression (e.g., road rage, domestic abuse, IED).

#### Psychopathy and violence

- Psychopaths often have smaller, under‑responsive amygdalae and reduced OFC volume.
- Lack empathy (including for future selves) and disregard long‑term consequences.

#### Social and legal frameworks

- Proportionality principle: Self‑defense violence must match the threat (e.g., Tony Martin vs. Fred Hemstock).
- Hot‑headed crimes often receive lighter sentences due to perceived lack of future threat; premeditated violence is punished more harshly.

#### Anger management

- Maturation of prefrontal regions into mid‑twenties underlies improved impulse control.
- Strategies: boundary signaling, “turn the other cheek,” regulated expressions deter antisocial behavior.

### Questions

1. **What brain region is most associated with the urge for revenge?**
2. **How does evolutionary theory explain the retention of wrath in humans?**
3. **What distinguishes instrumental aggression from reactive aggression?**
4. **Why are psychopaths less deterred by potential consequences of violence?**
5. **How does the legal system differentiate between permissible and excessive violence?**

### Summary

Wrath, rooted in evolution, helped humans gain resources and status but comes with destructive risks.
It is driven by brain regions like the amygdala and ACC, while impulse control depends on the prefrontal cortex.
Anger shows up as either impulsive (reactive) or planned (instrumental) aggression.
Psychopaths, lacking empathy and foresight, often show the latter.
Society manages wrath through legal limits and social rules, and as the brain matures, self-control improves.
