## This Thing Called Sleep

### To Sleep

1. Why is sleep deprivation dangerous?
    - It drastically increases risk for chronic diseases, weakens the immune system, and shortens life.
1. What surprising factor causes more car crashes than alcohol?
    - Drowsy driving.
1. Why was sleep scientifically misunderstood for so long?
    - It seemed biologically disadvantageous and lacked a clear singular purpose.
1. What does sleep benefit in the brain?
    - Memory, emotional regulation, learning, and creativity through dreaming.
1. What does Walker argue about sleep’s role in health?
    - Sleep is the most powerful daily health enhancer we have-more essential than diet or exercise.

### Caffeine, Jet Lag, and Melatonin

1. What are the two systems that regulate sleep?
    - The circadian rhythm (24-hour clock) and adenosine sleep pressure.
1. What role does melatonin play in sleep?
    - It signals darkness and the start of sleep time but does not cause sleep directly.
1. Why does jet lag occur, and how can melatonin help?
    - Jet lag is a mismatch between internal time and local time; melatonin helps adjust sleep timing, not sleep generation.
1. Why is traveling east harder than west?
    - Because our biological clock runs longer than 24 hours, making it easier to stay up late than to sleep early.
1. How does caffeine affect sleep?
    - It blocks adenosine receptors, hiding sleep pressure, and causes poor sleep if consumed too late.
1. What is a caffeine crash?
    - A sudden wave of sleepiness when caffeine wears off and adenosine floods receptors.
1. Why do night owls have worse health outcomes?
    - Society forces early schedules incompatible with their genetics, leading to chronic sleep loss.
1. How can you tell if you’re sleep-deprived?
    - Struggling to stay awake mid-morning or relying on caffeine early in the day are key signs.
1. Do the circadian rhythm and adenosine system communicate?
    - No - they are independent systems that usually align but can diverge (e.g., during all-nighters).

### Defining and Generating Sleep

1. What are the observable signs of sleep?
   - Recumbent posture, low muscle tone, no communication, reversibility, and timing consistency.
1. What brain structure blocks sensory input during sleep?
    - The thalamus - it creates a sensory blackout during NREM sleep.
1. What happens when we cut sleep short?
    - We disproportionately lose REM sleep, even if total sleep loss is small.
1. How do brainwaves differ between wakefulness and deep sleep?
   - Wake = fast, chaotic waves; NREM = slow, rhythmic waves from the frontal lobe.
1. What is a sleep spindle?
   - A burst of brain activity during NREM that helps shield sleep from noise.
1. Why does REM sleep include muscle paralysis?
   - To prevent acting out dreams, which could be dangerous.
1. How do REM and NREM sleep support memory?
   - NREM transfers and filters memories; REM links them and fosters insight.
1. What is the significance of time distortion in dreams?
   - Dream time feels longer than real time - due to slow replay of memories in REM.
1. How do sleep cycles change over the night?
   - Early cycles are NREM-rich, later ones are REM-rich.

### Ape Beds, Dinosaurs, and Napping with Half a Brain

1. How far back in evolution does sleep go?
    - Sleep likely predates vertebrates-seen even in worms and primitive animals.
1. Do all animals experience REM sleep?
    - No. Only mammals and birds have true REM sleep; reptiles and aquatic mammals show limited or altered forms.
1. What is unihemispheric sleep and which species have it?
    - Sleeping with one brain hemisphere at a time-seen in dolphins, whales, and birds for survival reasons.
1. Why do dolphins and seals lack REM sleep in the ocean?
    - REM causes full-body paralysis, which would be fatal while swimming.
1. What’s the difference between modern and natural human sleep?
    - Natural: **biphasic** (night + nap), ~7-8 hours total.
    - Modern: **monophasic**, often < 7 hours, later onset, no naps.
1. What health effects result from abandoning biphasic sleep?
   - Increased risk of cardiovascular disease and early death, as seen in modern Greece after siesta decline.
1. Why do humans have more REM sleep than other primates?
   - Ground sleeping made deep REM safer. REM supports complex brains, creativity, and emotional processing.
1. How does REM contribute to human intelligence?
   - Facilitates emotional regulation, social bonding, and creative problem-solving.
1. What evidence supports the evolutionary importance of REM sleep?
   - Its independent evolution in birds and mammals, widespread recovery after deprivation, and role in survival-critical traits.
1. Can sleep deprivation ever be avoided?
    - Only in rare evolutionary exceptions (e.g. migrating birds), but even they find micro-sleep strategies. **Sleep is non-negotiable.**

### Changes in Sleep Across the Life Span

1. Why is REM sleep so abundant before birth?
    - It supports **synaptogenesis**, helping build the brain's neural network.
2. How does alcohol affect fetal sleep?
    - It reduces **REM sleep quality & quantity**, potentially harming brain development and increasing neurodevelopmental risks.
3. What is the shift in sleep pattern during early childhood?
    - From **polyphasic** (many naps) to **monophasic** (one main sleep + maybe 1 nap), with **circadian rhythm maturing**.
4. Why is deep NREM sleep important in adolescence?
    - It supports **synaptic pruning**, optimizing brain circuits for reasoning and emotional control.
5. What is the circadian rhythm shift in teenagers?
    - Melatonin release happens later, so they fall asleep and wake later → **biologically driven**, not laziness.
6. How does aging affect deep sleep?
    - Massive decline in deep NREM due to **atrophy in frontal brain areas** that generate sleep.
7. Why do older adults have more fragmented sleep?
    - Causes: weak bladder, medications, less melatonin, and lighter sleep.
8. Do older adults really need less sleep?
    - No. Studies show they **need just as much**-they just can’t **generate** it effectively.
9. Can anything help elderly sleep better?
    - Yes: **light therapy**, **melatonin**, and promising **brain stimulation techniques**.
10. What’s the health impact of poor sleep in old age?
    - Linked to **memory loss, depression, falls, heart disease, and dementia**. It’s a **major health concern**.

## Why Should You Sleep

### Your Mother and Shakespeare Knew

1. What is the main role of NREM sleep for memory?
    - It consolidates memories by transferring them from the hippocampus to the cortex, freeing space for new learning.
2. How does a nap affect learning capacity?
    - It boosts learning ability by about **20%**, thanks to stage 2 NREM and sleep spindles.
3. Which sleep stage is key for memorizing facts?
    - **Deep NREM sleep**-especially in the early part of the night.
4. What do sleep spindles do (regarding memory)?
    - Short bursts of brain activity during stage 2 NREM that help transfer and organize memories.
5. Can sleep help us forget?
    - Yes-**NREM sleep spindles** allow the brain to **filter out irrelevant info**, optimizing recall efficiency.
6. What is targeted memory reactivation (TMR)?
    - A method where **sound cues** during sleep re-trigger specific memories, enhancing only those.
7. What’s the role of REM in creativity?
    - REM helps connect unrelated memories, enhancing **creative problem-solving**.
8. What kind of sleep enhances motor skill performance?
    - **Late-stage NREM sleep with sleep spindles**, especially in the last 2 hours of sleep.
9. How does sleep loss affect athletic performance?
    - Reduces stamina, strength, coordination, and increases **injury risk** by up to 60%.
10. How does the brain choose what to remember or forget during sleep?
    - Through **tags** (conscious intention or emotional salience) and interaction between hippocampus and frontal cortex during spindles.

### Too Extreme for the Guinness Book of World Records

1. What is a microsleep and why is it dangerous?
    - A momentary loss of consciousness (1-2 seconds); it disables perception and motor control - deadly while driving.
2. How little sleep is needed to impair you like being drunk?
    - Just 19 hours awake makes you as impaired as someone legally drunk.
3. What did Dinges' research reveal about 6 hours of sleep?
    - Just 10 days of 6 hours/night equals performance impairment of one full night without sleep.
4. Can we recover sleep debt with extra weekend sleep?
    - No. Even after 3 nights of recovery, performance does not return to baseline.
5. How does sleep loss affect emotional regulation?
    - Increases amygdala reactivity (fear/anger), weakens control from the prefrontal cortex -> impulsivity and emotional outbursts.
6. What psychiatric illnesses are connected to poor sleep?
    - All major ones: depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety, PTSD, schizophrenia.
7. How does poor sleep contribute to Alzheimer’s?
    - It increases amyloid buildup and disrupts deep NREM sleep, which normally clears toxins.
8. What is the glymphatic system?
    - Brain’s waste clearance system - cleans up amyloid during deep NREM sleep.
9. Are power naps enough?
    - No. They help short-term focus but do not restore full brain function, memory, or emotional stability.
10. Is there a genetic trait for low-sleep tolerance?
    - Yes, but extremely rare (\<0.01% of people). You’re more likely to be struck by lightning.
