## This Thing Called Sleep

### To Sleep

1. Why is sleep deprivation dangerous?
    - It drastically increases risk for chronic diseases, weakens the immune system, and shortens life.
1. What surprising factor causes more car crashes than alcohol?
    - Drowsy driving.
1. Why was sleep scientifically misunderstood for so long?
    - It seemed biologically disadvantageous and lacked a clear singular purpose.
1. What does sleep benefit in the brain?
    - Memory, emotional regulation, learning, and creativity through dreaming.
1. What does Walker argue about sleep’s role in health?
    - Sleep is the most powerful daily health enhancer we have-more essential than diet or exercise.

### Caffeine, Jet Lag, and Melatonin

1. What are the two systems that regulate sleep?
    - The circadian rhythm (24-hour clock) and adenosine sleep pressure.
1. What role does melatonin play in sleep?
    - It signals darkness and the start of sleep time but does not cause sleep directly.
1. Why does jet lag occur, and how can melatonin help?
    - Jet lag is a mismatch between internal time and local time; melatonin helps adjust sleep timing, not sleep generation.
1. Why is traveling east harder than west?
    - Because our biological clock runs longer than 24 hours, making it easier to stay up late than to sleep early.
1. How does caffeine affect sleep?
    - It blocks adenosine receptors, hiding sleep pressure, and causes poor sleep if consumed too late.
1. What is a caffeine crash?
    - A sudden wave of sleepiness when caffeine wears off and adenosine floods receptors.
1. Why do night owls have worse health outcomes?
    - Society forces early schedules incompatible with their genetics, leading to chronic sleep loss.
1. How can you tell if you’re sleep-deprived?
    - Struggling to stay awake mid-morning or relying on caffeine early in the day are key signs.
1. Do the circadian rhythm and adenosine system communicate?
    - No - they are independent systems that usually align but can diverge (e.g., during all-nighters).

### Defining and Generating Sleep

1. What are the observable signs of sleep?
   - Recumbent posture, low muscle tone, no communication, reversibility, and timing consistency.
1. What brain structure blocks sensory input during sleep?
    - The thalamus - it creates a sensory blackout during NREM sleep.
1. What happens when we cut sleep short?
    - We disproportionately lose REM sleep, even if total sleep loss is small.
1. How do brainwaves differ between wakefulness and deep sleep?
   - Wake = fast, chaotic waves; NREM = slow, rhythmic waves from the frontal lobe.
1. What is a sleep spindle?
   - A burst of brain activity during NREM that helps shield sleep from noise.
1. Why does REM sleep include muscle paralysis?
   - To prevent acting out dreams, which could be dangerous.
1. How do REM and NREM sleep support memory?
   - NREM transfers and filters memories; REM links them and fosters insight.
1. What is the significance of time distortion in dreams?
   - Dream time feels longer than real time - due to slow replay of memories in REM.
1. How do sleep cycles change over the night?
   - Early cycles are NREM-rich, later ones are REM-rich.

### Ape Beds, Dinosaurs, and Napping with Half a Brain

1. How far back in evolution does sleep go?
    - Sleep likely predates vertebrates-seen even in worms and primitive animals.
1. Do all animals experience REM sleep?
    - No. Only mammals and birds have true REM sleep; reptiles and aquatic mammals show limited or altered forms.
1. What is unihemispheric sleep and which species have it?
    - Sleeping with one brain hemisphere at a time-seen in dolphins, whales, and birds for survival reasons.
1. Why do dolphins and seals lack REM sleep in the ocean?
    - REM causes full-body paralysis, which would be fatal while swimming.
1. What’s the difference between modern and natural human sleep?
    - Natural: **biphasic** (night + nap), ~7-8 hours total.
    - Modern: **monophasic**, often < 7 hours, later onset, no naps.
1. What health effects result from abandoning biphasic sleep?
   - Increased risk of cardiovascular disease and early death, as seen in modern Greece after siesta decline.
1. Why do humans have more REM sleep than other primates?
   - Ground sleeping made deep REM safer. REM supports complex brains, creativity, and emotional processing.
1. How does REM contribute to human intelligence?
   - Facilitates emotional regulation, social bonding, and creative problem-solving.
1. What evidence supports the evolutionary importance of REM sleep?
   - Its independent evolution in birds and mammals, widespread recovery after deprivation, and role in survival-critical traits.
1. Can sleep deprivation ever be avoided?
    - Only in rare evolutionary exceptions (e.g. migrating birds), but even they find micro-sleep strategies. **Sleep is non-negotiable.**
