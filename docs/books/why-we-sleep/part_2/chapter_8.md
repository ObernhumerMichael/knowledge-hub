# Cancer, Heart Attacks, and a Shorter Life

## üß† Summary

Sleep is not just a pillar of health - it‚Äôs the **foundation**.
This chapter details how insufficient sleep ravages nearly every major **physiological system** in the body.
It increases the risk of **heart disease**, **stroke**, **diabetes**, **obesity**, **infertility**, **immune dysfunction**, and **cancer**.
Even modest sleep loss triggers an overactive **sympathetic nervous system**, raising blood pressure and cortisol while reducing growth hormone and immune cell activity.
Poor sleep leads to **DNA damage**, shortened **telomeres**, and impaired gene regulation, effectively **aging** the body and increasing **mortality risk**.
Modern sleep neglect isn't just harmful - it‚Äôs potentially lethal.

## üìì Notes

### ‚ù§Ô∏è Cardiovascular System

- \<6h sleep: **45%$\uparrow$** risk of coronary heart disease.
- \<6h sleep: **400-500%$\uparrow$** risk of cardiac arrest (Japan study).
- One night of \<6h: $\uparrow$ heart rate + $\uparrow$ blood pressure (even in young, healthy people).
- Mechanism: overactive **sympathetic nervous system** + cortisol $\uparrow$ + growth hormone $\downarrow$.
- Daylight saving time: 1h loss -> **$\uparrow$ heart attacks**; 1h gain -> **$\downarrow$ heart attacks**.

### üç¨ Metabolism & Diabetes

- Sleep \<6h = 40% $\downarrow$ glucose absorption -> pre-diabetic state.
- Causes **insulin resistance**; cells refuse glucose -> **hyperglycemia**.
- Results: $\uparrow$ risk of **type 2 diabetes**, even with normal diet & activity.

### ‚öñÔ∏è Weight Gain & Obesity

- Hormones affected:
  - $\downarrow$ **leptin** = no ‚ÄúI‚Äôm full‚Äù signal.
  - $\uparrow$ **ghrelin** = stronger hunger.
- Short sleep = +300+ kcal/day intake.
- Preference for **junk food** ($\uparrow$ endocannabinoids & impulsive brain activity).
- Long-term: $\uparrow$ weight, $\downarrow$ muscle loss during dieting, $\uparrow$ cravings for sugar/salt.

### üß¨ Reproductive System

- Men: 5h sleep -> $\downarrow$ testosterone, $\downarrow$ sperm count, $\uparrow$ deformities.
- Women: \<6h sleep -> $\downarrow$ ovulation hormones, $\uparrow$ menstrual irregularities, $\uparrow$ miscarriage risk.
- Sleep-deprived people rated as **less attractive**.

### üõ°Ô∏è Immune System

- Sleep $\downarrow$ -> $\downarrow$ natural killer cells by 70% (1 night).
- Vaccines (flu, hepatitis) are **less effective** with poor sleep.
- Sleep-deprived: $\uparrow$ inflammation, weakened immunity.

### ‚ò†Ô∏è Cancer Risk

- Sleep loss = $\uparrow$ cancer (breast, prostate, colon, uterus).
- WHO: night shift work = ‚Äúprobable carcinogen.‚Äù
- Mouse studies: sleep loss = $\uparrow$ tumor size + $\uparrow$ metastasis.
- $\downarrow$ M1 (anti-tumor) macrophages; $\uparrow$ M2 (tumor-promoting).

### üß¨ Genes & DNA

- Short sleep (6h for 1 week) -> alters **711 gene expressions**.
- $\uparrow$ expression: inflammation, stress, heart disease genes.
- $\downarrow$ expression: immune regulation, metabolism.
- Sleep loss damages **telomeres** = biological aging $\uparrow$.

## ‚ùì Questions & Answers

1. **How does sleep loss affect the heart?**
    - It increases heart rate, raises blood pressure, damages vessels, and risk of heart attacks/strokes.
1. **Can one bad night of sleep hurt your heart?**
    - Yes - even 1-2 hours less sleep = increased heart rate and blood pressure.
1. **How is sleep connected to diabetes?**
    - It impairs **glucose regulation** by causing **insulin resistance** - a pathway to **type 2 diabetes**.
1. **What happens to appetite hormones during sleep deprivation?**
    - less **Leptin**, more **Ghrelin** = increased hunger and overeating.
1. **Does sleep loss increase cancer risk?**
    - Yes - by weakening immune response and fueling inflammation and **tumor metastasis**.
1. **How is reproductive health affected?**
    - Men: lower testosterone, sperm count, testicle size.
    - Women: less fertility hormones, more miscarriage, increased cycle irregularities.
1. **Why are vaccines less effective with poor sleep?**
    - The immune system produces **fewer antibodies** in sleep-deprived people.
1. **What is the link between sleep and genes?**
    - Sleep loss distorts expression of **over 700 genes**, affecting immunity, metabolism, and aging.
1. **What are telomeres, and how does sleep affect them?**
    - Telomeres protect chromosomes; sleep deprivation **shortens** them = **accelerated aging**.
1. **Why is the sympathetic nervous system harmful when overactive?**
    - It keeps the body in chronic ‚Äúfight or flight,‚Äù promoting **hypertension**, **inflammation**, and **organ damage**.
