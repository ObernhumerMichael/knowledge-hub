    "description": "This section explores the mysterious world of dreams, particularly during REM sleep. Walker dives into the neuroscience of dreaming, explaining how dreams contribute to emotional healing, creativity, and problem-solving. He discusses the brainâ€™s activity during REM sleep and shows how dreaming helps us process emotions, make sense of experiences, and form abstract connections. The chapters also challenge common myths about dreaming and highlight the role of REM sleep in mental health and cognitive flexibility."
