# Routinely Psychotic

## üß† Summary

This chapter explores the **science of dreaming** during REM sleep, which mirrors many symptoms of psychosis - hallucinations, delusions, disorientation, emotional swings, and amnesia.
Through modern brain imaging, scientists have mapped the **active brain regions during REM** (visual, motor, emotional, memory) and the **deactivated** prefrontal cortex (logic).
Dreams are thus vivid and emotional but irrational.
The chapter critiques Freud‚Äôs dream theory as unscientific and introduces new evidence-based insights, including **dream decoding via MRI** and the role of dreams in processing **emotional concerns**.
Contrary to Freud, dreams are not veiled wish-fulfillments but transparent reflections of emotional experiences.

## üìì Notes

### üß† Dreams Resemble Psychosis

- REM dream symptoms:
  - **Hallucinations** (seeing what isn‚Äôt there)
  - **Delusions** (believing what isn‚Äôt true)
  - **Disorientation** (time, place, person)
  - **Emotional instability**
  - **Amnesia** (forgetting the dream)

### üß¨ Where Dreams Come From (Brain Activity)

- REM sleep activates:
  - **Visual cortex** -> vivid imagery
  - **Motor cortex** -> movement plans
  - **Amygdala & cingulate cortex** -> emotion
  - **Hippocampus** -> autobiographical memory
- REM **deactivates** prefrontal cortex -> logic suppressed

### üß™ Brain Imaging Breakthroughs

- MRI provides detailed, 3D brain activity maps
- Allows predictions of:
  - **Dream type** (visual, emotional, motoric)
  - Even **some dream content** (e.g. "a man", "a car") via pattern matching (Kamitani et al., 2013)
- Ethical concern: dream **privacy and ownership**

### üß† Freud‚Äôs Dream Theory: Critique

- Freud‚Äôs claim: dreams = **disguised wish fulfillment**
- "Manifest" dream hides the "latent" content
- Lacks scientific testability (not falsifiable)
- Psychoanalysts gave **wildly different interpretations** for same dream
- Freudian method = **unreliable, generic, and non-replicable**

### üß† Modern View: Dreams Reflect Emotion, Not Hidden Desires

- Experiment (Stickgold):
  - Participants recorded day events and dreams
  - Only **1-2%** of dreams directly repeated waking events (‚Äúday residue‚Äù)
  - But **35-55%** mirrored emotional themes from waking life
- No need for hidden messages - dream content is **emotionally transparent**

### üß© Do Dreams Have a Function?

- REM sleep has clear biological functions (memory, emotional regulation)
- Emerging evidence suggests **dreams themselves** also serve a purpose (to be explored in next chapter)

## ‚ùì Questions & Answers

1. **Why is REM sleep described as ‚Äúroutinely psychotic‚Äù?**
   - Because it mimics symptoms like hallucinations, delusions, and emotional instability - but safely during sleep.
1. **Which brain regions are more active during REM sleep?**
   - **Visual cortex**
   - **Motor cortex**
   - **Amygdala & cingulate cortex (emotion)**
   - **Hippocampus (memory)**
1. **What brain region is suppressed during REM sleep, and why is that important?**
   - The **prefrontal cortex**, which controls logic and rationality, is deactivated - explaining why dreams are illogical.
1. **How did MRI technology help understand dreams?**
   - It allowed scientists to **see brain activity in detail**, predict dream types, and even decode dream **content** using waking visual templates.
1. **Do dreams replay your day?**
   - No. Only ~1-2% of dreams replay daily events; instead, they reflect **emotional concerns** (35-55%).
