# Caffeine, Jet Lag, and Melatonin

## Notes

### Circadian Rhythm & Sleep Pressure

- **Two main sleep drivers**:
  1. **Circadian rhythm**: 24-hour internal clock controlled by the *suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN)*, regulates sleep/wake cycles, temperature, mood, and hormones.
  2. **Adenosine sleep pressure**: Builds up the longer you're awake; removed during sleep.

### Biological Clocks & Internal Timing

- All organisms have endogenous (self-generated) circadian rhythms.
- Historical experiments (plants, humans in caves) showed internal clocks tick slightly longer than 24 hours.
- **Light** is the main zeitgeber (time-giver) that resets our biological clock daily.

### Chronotypes: Larks vs. Owls

- **Chronotype = genetic sleep timing preference**:
  - 40% morning types (larks), 30% evening types (owls), 30% intermediate.
- Night owls suffer from societal bias (early schedules), often leading to sleep debt and poorer health.

### Melatonin: The Signal, Not the Cause

- Melatonin is the **timing signal** for sleep, not the generator.
- Secreted at night by the pineal gland under instruction from the SCN.
- Fades by morning as light suppresses production.

### Jet Lag & Time Zone Travel

- Jet lag = mismatch between internal clock and local time.
- Takes \~1 day per time zone to adjust.
- **Melatonin supplements** can help realign timing but don’t induce sleep directly.
- Eastward travel is harder than westward due to biological clock running longer than 24 hours.

### Caffeine & Sleep Interference

- **Caffeine blocks adenosine receptors**, masking sleepiness without removing the pressure.
- Long half-life (5–7 hours); even decaf contains some caffeine.
- Sensitivity depends on genetics and age.
- **Caffeine crash**: Occurs when adenosine floods receptors after caffeine wears off.

### Interaction Between Sleep Systems

- **Circadian rhythm and adenosine work independently** but typically align.
- During sleep, adenosine is cleared, circadian rhythm prepares the body to wake.
- Staying awake (e.g. all-nighter) reveals their independence: alertness may rise with the circadian peak despite mounting sleep pressure.

### Are You Getting Enough Sleep?

- Indicators of insufficient sleep:
  - Can fall asleep at 10–11 a.m.
  - Need caffeine before noon.
  - Wake past alarm time without one.
  - Forgetfulness, rereading sentences, distracted driving.
- **Sleep debt accumulates**, causing chronic fatigue.

## Questions & Answers

1. **What are the two systems that regulate sleep?**
    - The circadian rhythm (24-hour clock) and adenosine sleep pressure.
1. **What role does melatonin play in sleep?**
    - It signals darkness and the start of sleep time but does **not cause** sleep directly.
1. **Why does jet lag occur, and how can melatonin help?**
    - Jet lag is a mismatch between internal time and local time; melatonin helps adjust sleep timing, not sleep generation.
1. **Why is traveling east harder than west?**
    - Because our biological clock runs longer than 24 hours, making it easier to stay up late than to sleep early.
1. **How does caffeine affect sleep?**
    - It blocks adenosine receptors, hiding sleep pressure, and causes poor sleep if consumed too late.
1. **What is a caffeine crash?**
    - A sudden wave of sleepiness when caffeine wears off and adenosine floods receptors.
1. **Why do night owls have worse health outcomes?**
    - Society forces early schedules incompatible with their genetics, leading to chronic sleep loss.
1. **How can you tell if you’re sleep-deprived?**
    - Struggling to stay awake mid-morning or relying on caffeine early in the day are key signs.
1. **Do the circadian rhythm and adenosine system communicate?**
    - No - they are **independent** systems that usually align but can diverge (e.g., during all-nighters).

## Summary

This chapter explains how our sleep is controlled by two separate systems: the 24-hour circadian rhythm and adenosine-driven sleep pressure.
Light, melatonin, and genetics all influence when we feel sleepy.
Modern life - through caffeine, jet lag, and social structures - often disrupts these systems.
Understanding their independence and effects helps explain fatigue, sleep disorders, and why we struggle with sleep timing.
Sleep isn’t just a passive need - it’s a tightly regulated, easily disrupted biological imperative.
