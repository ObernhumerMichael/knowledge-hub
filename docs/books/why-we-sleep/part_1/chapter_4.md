# Ape Beds, Dinosaurs, and Napping with Half a Brain

## Notes

### Evolution of Sleep

- Sleep is found across all animals: insects, fish, reptiles, mammals, birds.
- Even worms (~500 + million years old) sleep → sleep predates vertebrates.
- Sleep likely originated **before wakefulness** as the default biological state.

### Variations Across Species

- Sleep needs vary wildly: bats sleep 19h, giraffes ~4h.
- No strong correlation with size, intelligence, diet alone.
- Possibly linked to **brain complexity relative to body size**.

### REM vs. NREM

- All animals have **NREM**, only birds/mammals have **REM**.
- REM = newer evolutionary development.
- **Aquatic mammals** like dolphins/seals have minimal REM (due to paralysis risk).
- Some reptiles might show proto-REM → REM may be older than thought.

### Split-Brain Sleep

- Dolphins: **unihemispheric sleep**-one brain half sleeps, the other stays awake.
- Birds: similar adaptation, especially for safety in flocks.
- Humans: slight version seen in unfamiliar settings (e.g. first night effect in hotels).

### Extreme Sleep Deprivation

- Starvation/fear can override sleep (flies, whales, birds).
- Migrating birds take micro-sleeps mid-flight.
- White-crowned sparrow shows near-immunity to sleep deprivation during migration.

### Natural vs. Modern Sleep

- Pre-industrial societies show **biphasic** sleep: night sleep + afternoon nap.
- Modern life imposes **monophasic, late** sleep, < 7h avg.
- Cultural shift (e.g., Greece ending siestas) linked to higher cardiovascular mortality.

### Human Uniqueness

- Humans sleep **less** but have **more REM** than any other primate.
- Transition from trees to ground sleeping allowed deeper REM.
- Fire and safety enabled efficient, rich REM-filled sleep.

### REM Sleep & Human Evolution

- REM supports **emotional regulation** -> enables **empathy, cooperation**.
- REM boosts **creativity** by forging new neural connections.
- Feedback loop: better sleep -> higher social & creative function -> stronger need for sleep.
- REM sleep may have powered Homo sapiens' rise to **global dominance**.

## Questions & Answers

1. **How far back in evolution does sleep go?**
    - Sleep likely predates vertebrates-seen even in worms and primitive animals.
1. **Do all animals experience REM sleep?**
    - No. Only mammals and birds have true REM sleep; reptiles and aquatic mammals show limited or altered forms.
1. **What is unihemispheric sleep and which species have it?**
    - Sleeping with one brain hemisphere at a time-seen in dolphins, whales, and birds for survival reasons.
1. **Why do dolphins and seals lack REM sleep in the ocean?**
    - REM causes full-body paralysis, which would be fatal while swimming.
1. **What’s the difference between modern and natural human sleep?**
    - Natural: **biphasic** (night + nap), ~7-8 hours total.
    - Modern: **monophasic**, often < 7 hours, later onset, no naps.
1. **What health effects result from abandoning biphasic sleep?**
   - Increased risk of cardiovascular disease and early death, as seen in modern Greece after siesta decline.
1. **Why do humans have more REM sleep than other primates?**
   - Ground sleeping made deep REM safer. REM supports complex brains, creativity, and emotional processing.
1. **How does REM contribute to human intelligence?**
   - Facilitates emotional regulation, social bonding, and creative problem-solving.
1. **What evidence supports the evolutionary importance of REM sleep?**
   - Its independent evolution in birds and mammals, widespread recovery after deprivation, and role in survival-critical traits.
1. **Can sleep deprivation ever be avoided?**
    - Only in rare evolutionary exceptions (e.g. migrating birds), but even they find micro-sleep strategies. **Sleep is non-negotiable.**

## Summary

This chapter explores the **evolutionary origins and diversity of sleep** across the animal kingdom.
Sleep is universal-even primitive worms and insects show sleep-like states, indicating it predates vertebrate life.
Yet, species differ vastly in **how long, how deeply, and in what form** they sleep.
REM sleep (dreaming) is exclusive to mammals and birds, while dolphins and seals exhibit unihemispheric NREM sleep to stay mobile and safe.
Despite occasional deprivation in extreme situations, all species must sleep.
Humans are unique: we sleep less than other primates but experience unusually **rich REM sleep**, which may have enabled emotional intelligence, creativity, and our rise as a dominant species.
Modern sleep patterns (monophasic, short, late) differ from our natural, likely **biphasic** rhythm, with proven consequences for health and longevity.
