# Defining and Generating Sleep

## Notes

### Defining Sleep

- Sleep is identified by observable traits:
  - Recumbent posture, reduced muscle tone.
  - Lack of responsiveness, reversibility (not coma).
  - Circadian timing.
- Subjective sleep:
  - **Loss of external awareness** (thalamus blocks sensory input).
  - **Distortion of time**:
    - Loss of conscious time-tracking.
    - Precise subconscious time-keeping.
    - Dream time = dilated (appears longer).

### REM vs. NREM

- **REM (Rapid Eye Movement)**: active brain, darting eyes → dreaming.
- **NREM (Non-REM)**: slow, calm brain activity, no eye movement.
  - NREM later subdivided into 4 stages (1–4), with 3 and 4 as **deep sleep**.

### Sleep Cycles & Architecture

- NREM and REM alternate in \~90-minute **cycles**.
- First half of the night = **NREM-heavy** (memory consolidation).
- Second half = **REM-heavy** (emotional/creative processing).
- Cutting sleep short (e.g., waking at 6am instead of 8am) disproportionately cuts **REM sleep**.

### Brain Activity During Sleep

- **Wakefulness**: fast, erratic, unsynchronized brainwaves.
- **NREM sleep**: slow, synchronized waves from **frontal lobes** to back.
  - Sleep spindles protect sleep from noise.
  - Helps **transfer memories** from short- to long-term storage.
- **REM sleep**: brain resembles wake state, but with body **paralysis** (atonia).
  - Cortex active; thalamus sends internally generated signals (emotions, memories).
  - Eye movements are a physiological feature of REM, not dream tracking.

### Functions of Sleep Stages

- **Wake** = reception.
- **NREM** = reflection (storage, pruning).
- **REM** = integration (emotional insight, creativity, problem-solving).
- REM body paralysis prevents enacting dreams (fails in some disorders).

## Questions & Answers

1. **What are the observable signs of sleep?**
   - Recumbent posture, low muscle tone, no communication, reversibility, and timing consistency.
1. **What brain structure blocks sensory input during sleep?**
    - The **thalamus**—it creates a sensory blackout during NREM sleep.
1. **What happens when we cut sleep short?**
    - We disproportionately lose **REM sleep**, even if total sleep loss is small.
1. **How do brainwaves differ between wakefulness and deep sleep?**
   - Wake = fast, chaotic waves; NREM = slow, rhythmic waves from the frontal lobe.
1. **What is a sleep spindle?**
   - A burst of brain activity during NREM that helps shield sleep from noise.
1. **Why does REM sleep include muscle paralysis?**
   - To prevent **acting out dreams**, which could be dangerous.
1. **How do REM and NREM sleep support memory?**
   - NREM transfers and filters memories; REM links them and fosters insight.
1. **What is the significance of time distortion in dreams?**
   - Dream time feels longer than real time - due to **slow replay** of memories in REM.
1. **How do sleep cycles change over the night?**
   - Early cycles are **NREM-rich**, later ones are **REM-rich**.

## Summary

Chapter 3 explores how sleep is defined, measured, and generated.
Scientists distinguish two sleep types - NREM and REM - based on brainwaves, eye movement, and muscle tone.
Sleep cycles alternate between these stages, with REM gaining dominance later in the night.
NREM sleep supports memory storage; REM sleep integrates and connects experiences.
The brain enters rhythmic, synchronous states to process and protect memories, while REM dreams occur in a paralyzed body.
Cutting sleep disrupts this balance and robs the brain of critical restorative processes.
