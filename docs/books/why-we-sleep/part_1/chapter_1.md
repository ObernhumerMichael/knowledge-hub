# To Sleep

## Notes

### Sleep Deprivation Crisis

- $ 2/3 $ of adults in developed countries don’t get enough sleep.
- Less than 6–7 hours a night:
  - Weakens immune system.
  - Increases risk of cancer, Alzheimer’s, heart disease, stroke.
  - Disrupts blood sugar, causes weight gain, worsens mental health.
- WHO labels it a **global epidemic**.
- Sleep loss kills directly (genetic insomnia) and indirectly (drowsy driving causes more accidents than alcohol/drugs).

### Scientific Neglect of Sleep

- Sleep long defied scientific explanation.
- Evolutionarily puzzling: sleep prevents mating, eating, safety.
- But all animals sleep → it's essential.

### Multiple Functions, Not One

- The question shouldn’t be “why,” but “what” sleep does.
- It enhances nearly every system:
  - Brain: memory, learning, emotion, creativity (via dreams).
  - Body: immunity, metabolism, cardiovascular health, appetite, gut microbiome.

1. **Why is sleep deprivation dangerous?**
    - It drastically increases risk for chronic diseases, weakens the immune system, and shortens life.
1. **What surprising factor causes more car crashes than alcohol?**
    - Drowsy driving.
1. **Why was sleep scientifically misunderstood for so long?**
    - It seemed biologically disadvantageous and lacked a clear singular purpose.
1. **What does sleep benefit in the brain?**

## Summary

Sleep is foundational to health, yet most people don’t get enough.
It supports nearly every body and brain function, from immunity to memory.
Far from being idle, sleep is biologically critical—its neglect leads to disease, mental decline, and even death.
