# Changes in Sleep Across the Life Span

## Notes

### Sleep Before Birth

- Fetuses spend most time in **REM-like sleep**.
- REM sleep increases dramatically before birth (up to 12h/day).
- Crucial for **synaptogenesis**-forming neural connections.
- Disrupting REM (e.g. via alcohol) leads to underdeveloped brains and possibly links to **autism**.

### Infancy & Childhood

- Infants: **polyphasic sleep**, \~50/50 REM-NREM split.
- Gradual consolidation to **biphasic** pattern by age 4.
- Circadian rhythm matures by \~4 months; fully functional by age 4.
- REM decreases while NREM increases → stabilizes at 80% NREM by late teens.

### Adolescence

- **Deep NREM sleep peaks**-prunes excess neural connections.
- Irwin Feinberg's research: sleep maturation precedes cognitive milestones.
- Maturation moves from back (visual cortex) to front (frontal cortex).
- **Frontal lobe (rationality)** matures last, explaining teen impulsivity.
- REM sleep gives way to **refining** with NREM as teens age.

### Teen Circadian Shifts

- Circadian rhythm shifts **later** in puberty.
- Teens feel sleepy later, wake later-biologically normal.
- Early school start times create chronic sleep deprivation.
- Evolutionary theory: later rhythms promote **peer bonding & independence**.

### Sleep in Older Adults

- **Myth**: they need less sleep - **False**. They **need same** but **can’t produce it**.
- Issues:
  1. **Less deep NREM** (up to 90% loss by age 70).
  2. **Fragmented sleep** (bathroom, meds, weak bladder).
  3. **Shifted circadian rhythm** → early to bed/wake.
- Consequences: cognitive decline, higher mortality, fall risk, poor memory.
- Cause: **brain atrophy** in deep-sleep regions (frontal lobe).
- Bright-light timing & melatonin can help.
- New solution: **electrical brain stimulation** to restore deep sleep.

## Questions & Answers

1. **Why is REM sleep so abundant before birth?**
    - It supports **synaptogenesis**, helping build the brain's neural network.
2. **How does alcohol affect fetal sleep?**
    - It reduces **REM sleep quality & quantity**, potentially harming brain development and increasing neurodevelopmental risks.
3. **What is the shift in sleep pattern during early childhood?**
    - From **polyphasic** (many naps) to **monophasic** (one main sleep + maybe 1 nap), with **circadian rhythm maturing**.
4. **Why is deep NREM sleep important in adolescence?**
    - It supports **synaptic pruning**, optimizing brain circuits for reasoning and emotional control.
5. **What is the circadian rhythm shift in teenagers?**
    - Melatonin release happens later, so they fall asleep and wake later → **biologically driven**, not laziness.
6. **How does aging affect deep sleep?**
    - Massive decline in deep NREM due to **atrophy in frontal brain areas** that generate sleep.
7. **Why do older adults have more fragmented sleep?**
    - Causes: weak bladder, medications, less melatonin, and lighter sleep.
8. **Do older adults really need less sleep?**
    - No. Studies show they **need just as much**-they just can’t **generate** it effectively.
9. **Can anything help elderly sleep better?**
    - Yes: **light therapy**, **melatonin**, and promising **brain stimulation techniques**.
10. **What’s the health impact of poor sleep in old age?**
    - Linked to **memory loss, depression, falls, heart disease, and dementia**. It’s a **major health concern**.

## Summary

This chapter outlines how sleep changes from the womb to old age.
In the womb, sleep-especially REM-supports early brain development.
During infancy and childhood, sleep patterns shift from polyphasic to monophasic, with NREM becoming dominant.
Adolescence brings deep NREM sleep critical for brain refinement, while a circadian shift causes teens to sleep and wake later.
In older age, deep sleep deteriorates due to brain atrophy, circadian rhythms regress, and sleep fragmentation increases.
Despite myths, older adults **need as much sleep as younger adults**-they just can't generate it as effectively, leading to cognitive and health consequences.
