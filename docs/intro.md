# Welcome to my Knowledge Hub ðŸ“š

This site is my personal collection of notes, summaries, guides, and other resources.

You'll find:

- **Book Summaries**: Key takeaways and reflections from books I've read.
- **Documentation & Guides**: Practical how-tos and reference material on tech topics and tools.
- **University & School Notes**: Well-structured content from my studies, covering lectures, assignments, and exam prep.
- **And More**: Anything else I find useful and want to keep in one place.

Whether you're here to learn something new, review a topic, or just browse, I hope you find these resources helpful!
