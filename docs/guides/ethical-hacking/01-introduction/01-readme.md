# What is this?

Welcome to my ethical hacking journey.
This documentation is a personal knowledge base and learning companion, built to capture what I’ve learned, practiced, and experienced in the world of ethical hacking.

My goal is not just to learn for myself, but to create a resource that helps others who are on a similar path.
Whether you're just getting started or already have some experience, I hope you find insights, guidance, and maybe even a few “aha” moments here.

Each section is broken down into structured, step-by-step lessons, tool guides, practical labs, and notes from real exercises.

Remember: With great power comes great responsibility.
All content here is strictly for educational and ethical purposes  -  use it to build, not break.
